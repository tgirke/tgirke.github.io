## Open Positions

### Postdoctoral positions in drug discovery and genome data science
Two postdoctoral positions are immediately available in the Girke lab at
University of California, Riverside to work on the integrative analysis of
large-scale small molecule bioactivity and a wide range of genome-wide
profiling data. 

The goal of this project is to identify systems-level insights
how drug-like small molecules interact with biological systems with the
long-term objective of developing novel pharmacological treatments for diseases
and promoting healthy aging.

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS: (I) Ph.D. and/or postdoctoral training in an area related
to computational biology, biostatistics, genome biology and drug discovery.
(II) Several years of experience with data analysis programming using
R/Bioconductor and/or Python. (III) High-level of proficiency in analyzing
high-throughput data, such as Next Generation Sequences (NGS) or other
large-scale assays. (IV) Ability to translate scientific data into biologically
relevant knowledge. (V) Strong publication record.

OTHER HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE: (i) Data analysis programming environments for
reproducible research. (ii) R/Bioconductor package development. (ii)
Familiarity with parallelization strategies of data analysis tasks on computer
clusters.

APPLICATION: To apply for this position, please email your CV, statement of
research interests and names of at least three references to Thomas Girke
(thomas.girke@ucr.edu).
